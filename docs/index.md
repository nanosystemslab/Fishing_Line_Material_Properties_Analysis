## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nanosystemslab/Fishing_Line_Material_Properties_Analysis
cd Fishing_Line_Material_Properties_Analysis
poetry install
```

### Basic Usage

Analyze a single tensile test file:

```bash
poetry run Fishing_Line_Material_Properties_Analysis analyze -i data/test.csv
```

Process multiple samples with statistical analysis:

```bash
poetry run Fishing_Line_Material_Properties_Analysis analyze -i data/group_1/5in/*.csv --plot-type multi
```

## Scientific Applications

This package is designed for researchers and engineers working with:

- **Fishing line materials** - monofilament, braided, and fluorocarbon lines
- **Textile fibers** - synthetic and natural fiber analysis
- **Thin film materials** - mechanical characterization of thin films
